					<p>
					</p><h3>4- Your Representations, Warranties & Obligations</h3>
					Unless We otherwise agree in writing: 
					<p>4.1 You are responsible for providing suitable hardware or communications equipment, and for all other infrastructure necessary to ensure Your access to the Smsga Platform.

We reserve the right to monitor your use of our Services for any reason or no reason, without notice, to insure your compliance with this Agreement and Our <a href="../aup/">Acceptable Use Policy</a>.</p>
					
					<p>4.4 You will inform Smsga immediately if you have reason to believe that there is likely to be an unauthorized or impermissible use of the Service.</p>

					<p>
					</p><h3>5- Warranties, Disclaimers & Liability</h3>
					<p>5.1  Smsga will provide You with Services that meet reasonable commercial standards. Smsga DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE FAULT-FREE, THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE AVAILABLE CONTINUOUSLY OR THAT ALL THE MOBILE OPERATORS WILL BE REACHABLE AT ALL TIMES.  FURTHERMORE, Smsga MAKES NO WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR OTHER UNDERTAKINGS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MOBILE OPERATORS OR THE PROVISION OF SERVICES AS CONTEMPLATED HEREIN, AND DISCLAIMS ALL TERMS NOT EXPRESSLY CONTAINED HEREIN, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, CONTRACTUAL, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES AS TO MERCHANTABILITY, QUALITY (INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES AS TO LATENCY AND THROUGHPUT), FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
					<p>5.2 Smsga cannot guarantee that the Services will not be faulty, and will take reasonable commercial efforts to correct reported faults and restore the Services as soon as practicable.</p>
					<p>5.3 Smsga may temporarily suspend the Services in order to undertake maintenance or upgrades. Smsga will endeavor to give You five (5) working days’ prior written notice of such suspension. When possible, such maintenance-related suspensions (excluding force majeure events or substantial or total outage of the Services, which we cannot foresee) will occur during off peak hours (0:00-6:00 CET).</p>
					<p>5.4 Smsga is not responsible in any way for any mobile telecommunications systems or networks, which We do not operate. Therefore Smsga is not liable for the acts or omissions of other providers of telecommunication services (including suspension or termination of Smsga connections and/or contracts with any mobile operator) or for faults in or failures of their apparatus or network, and in general for any other technical reason attributable to a mobile operator's network or a telecommunication service provider.</p>
					<p>5.5 You acknowledge that Smsga has no control over the information which passes through the Smsga platform or how the Services are used by end-users, and that Smsga does not examine the use of such information or the nature or the source of the information. You will be solely liable for the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the content transmitted by You or anyone else using the Services on Your behalf.  You agree to handle Your Smsga credentials (login/password) carefully and take responsibility for any and all use of Your credentials. Smsga disclaims all liability of any kind in connection with the transmission or reception of such content.  In case Your content is found to be offensive or unacceptable by third parties, Smsga  may, without owing any indemnity to You, with prior notice, immediately suspend (i.e. temporarily stop providing) or terminate the Services.</p>
					<p>5.6 Smsga WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES INCURRED BY YOU, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE OR INCOME, LOSS OR USE OF DATA, OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, HOWEVER ARISING AND WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING STRICT LIABILITY AND NEGLIGENCE) OR BASED ON BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY, EVEN IF YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LIMITED TO €10,000, AND YOU RELEASE US FROM ALL OBLIGATIONS, LIABILITY, CLAIMS OR DEMANDS IN EXCESS OF THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE LIMITATION IN THIS SECTION 5.8 DOES NOT APPLY WITH RESPECT TO YOUR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OR EXPRESS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS.</p>
					
					<h3>6- Indemnification</h3>
					<p>6.1 You will defend and handle at Your own expense, indemnify and hold harmless Smsga, parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliated companies, their respective officers, directors, employees and agents, subcontractors, suppliers (each, an "indemnified party") from and against any and all claims, demands, actions, damages, costs and expenses, or liability of whatever nature incurred or to be incurred by an indemnified party (including but not limited to costs of investigation and reasonable attorney and other third party fees and, to the extent permitted by law, fines and penalties) in connection with or arising from (i) Your use of the Services other than as expressly authorized in this Agreement, (ii) Your infringement of any third party intellectual property rights in connection with or arising from your use of the Services, (iii) any breach of this Agreement, and (iv) any claims arising from information, data, or messages transmitted by You using the Services that We contend comprise a violation of Our <a href="../aup/">Acceptable Use Policy.</a></p>
					
					<p>6.2 Smsga agrees to promptly notify You of any such claim, to permit You to control the defense and/or settlement of such claim and to assist You, at Your expense and reasonable request, in the defense and/or settlement of any such claim. You agree that Smsga may additionally participate, at Smsga expense, in the defense of any such claim through counsel of Our own choosing.</p>
				
					
					<h3>7- Dispute Resolution</h3>
					
					<p>7.1 This Agreement, and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement, will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to the choice of law rules of the State of California.</p>

					<p>7.2 You and Smsga agree to resolve disputes only by arbitration.  If either You or Smsga intends to seek arbitration under this Agreement, the party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 30 days in advance of initiating the arbitration.  Notice to Smsga should be sent as required by this Agreement.  The notice must describe the nature of the claim and the relief being sought.  If You and Smsga are unable to resolve our dispute within 30 days, either party may then proceed to file a claim for arbitration.  The location of arbitration will be: (a) in London, England and in accordance with the JAMS International Arbitration Rules, if Your principal place of business is outside of the United States; and (b) in San Francisco, California and in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, if Your principal place of business is inside of the United States.  No class or representative or private attorney general theories of liability or prayers for relief may be maintained in any arbitration held under this Agreement.  The tribunal will consist of one arbitrator. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings will be English. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p>

					<p>7.3  The arbitrator will not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation on actual compensatory, direct damages set forth in this Agreement and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under this Agreement, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages.  The arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing party) against any party to a proceeding.</p>

It is Your responsibility to keep Your email address current, and You will be deemed to have received any email sent to the last known email address we have on record for You.

					<h4>Additional Information Regarding the Use of Smsga US SMS Sevice:</h4>
					<p>1.	Our Smsga US long number SMS Service may not be used in a manner other than Peer-to-Peer. </p>
					<p>2.	A long number SMS message may originate from a mobile phone, a computer or an internet-based service, but the message must have been initiated due to human interaction, versus an automated or timed message. Each message is viewed as a single instantiation of these definitions (i.e., if a message is transmitted from a natural person to an application and a subsequent message is transmitted from the application to a natural person, such as a SMS search function for example). Although the "round-trip" appears as though the message originated from a natural person back to the same natural person, each message is viewed individually. To that end, the initial message is viewed as a single message sent from a natural person to an application and the subsequent message is viewed as a single message sent from an application to a natural person. Marketing SMS and mobile content delivery messages are not permitted on Smsga US long number SMS Services.</p>
					<p>3.	You (and any end user using the Service by or through You) are strictly prohibited from using Smsga Inbound and Outbound Services in connection with any call types that would result in Smsga incurring originating access charges, local exchange carrier "DIP" fees or other call types that may be subject to reverse billing process, application or charge. In the even that You (and any end user using the Service by or through You) fail to comply with the terms of this section, Smsga may (i) immediately suspend or terminate the Service without notice or opportunity to cure and (ii) charge You an additional $0.05 per minute or SMS of use for all Smsga Inbound Services from and after the date of any violation.</p> 
					<p>4.	If you utilize our Services using a dedicated short code, you must pay set-up and recurring fees that We specify <a href="../pricing/">HERE</a>.  Unless We otherwise agree in writing, You will be the named owner of any short code assigned to You by Neustar or other authorizing organization.  At any time during or after the Term You may cause such dedicated short code to become associated with the SMS network provider of Your choosing.  Note that We have the right to terminate Your short code if you fail to timely pay the fees we specify.
